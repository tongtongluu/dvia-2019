## Part1: Exploratory Visualizations
### used excel
** 1. abnormal years (Line Chart)**

This chart indicates that there are two abnormal years for the number of tests, they are 1958 and 1962. The cold war really started by then

**2.General tendency (Full table)**

Generally, the number of tests reduced tremendously. However general numbers cannot offer us more information.

**3. Two Representative Countries**

Among all the countries, US and USSR occupied almost half of the total tests, which was pretty interesting that they are representative figures for capitalism and communism parties.

## Part2 Design Ideas

**Concept 1 Two balls:**

Choosing US and USSR, I want to show their number of tests altogether. it formed as a huge bubble, and small bubbles come out which represent the detailed number of tests for each year.

**Concept 2 Turning balls**

Again about the two countries, the bubble in the middle represent the number of tests. the arcs shows the number of air bomb and number of underground tests accordingly.
Also made comparasion about the two countries

**Concept 3 XY graph:**
Trying to make a 3D graph that for US as the Y axis and USSR as X axis. they two made the x and y value for a point for each year.
and i am thinking if I can make a regression line about it

## Part3 Other Data: population and education attainment rate
I want to study the educational attatinment rate(better the data about nuclear industry education) to see if US and USSR during the Cold War ever put  emphasis on education for the bomb competition.
I find data from the United Nations for the population of the two countries from 1960s to 2010s.
Then I read the reports from the World Bank to extract the data about education.
The data I collected is the gross rate of primary educational rate. To my surprise, USSR during the cold war acctually have higer education rate than US.
The data can be found in the folder [here](https://github.com/tongtongluu/dvia-2019/blob/master/2.mapping-quantities/project/04_final)
