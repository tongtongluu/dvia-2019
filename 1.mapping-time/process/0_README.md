## Process: Project One

## part 1: variation basics
Retinal Vaviable variations: it is my first time dealing with the design basics. My results can be seen here:

## part 2:Three prefresentations of the current wall-clock time:
Design1: Round Clock,
1. use green as the main color
2. circles that represent second hand
3. minute hand and hour hand are represented from outer circle to inner circle accordingly.

Design2: Square Clock, 
1. use blue as the main color, 
2. the squares added little by little when the time pass by.
3. Also use different shades of blue to present second hand, minute hand and hour hand.

Design3: Lines Clock, 
1. got inspired by the dotted lines. 
2. When adding second, minute or hours, the number of lines increases until it covers the whole screen.
3. number of lines represent the number of seconds/minutes/hours

## part 3: Programming the clocks
Three representations of the current wall-clock time based on the sketch from part2
(see for each readme file of the project)

## part 4: Three Calendar View Designs
Design1: Github commit view,
1. build the calendar view, differentiate seassons by for colors,
2. green for spring, yellow for summer, orange for autumn and blue for winter accordingly
3. Each monday is darker than the rest of the days

Design2: camera with different circles, 
1. Inspired by camera. 
2. each circle represent a time measurement from seconds, minute to seasons. 
3. the specific moment is highlighted by the colors

Design3: cat eyes, 
1. play around the variables of the circle, create a eye-like calendar. 
2. Also use same four colors to represent seasons.
3. pointers changes to show the day ranges in one month

## part 5: Hybrid calendar and clock
1. built on the camera view
2. want to add some difference bewteen day view and calendar view
3. inspired by the painting from Pace Gallery this past seasons
4. Also inspired by the Chinese Yin and Yang(negative and positive philosophy)
