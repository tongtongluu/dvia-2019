## Process

## Part1: Exploratory Visualizations
### used excel
** 1. **
This chart indicates that there rms and horizontal error are highly related with each other

**2.**

Alaska has the most frequency of earthquake

**3. **

latitude can be an interesting finding, but it is hard for me to do any visuals besides map about lat and long

## Part2 Design Ideas

**Concept 1 heartbeat:**

I found out the depth can be the undergraound part and magnitude can rise above the ground. the two variables interact with each other like heart beats

**Concept 2 ufo**

I draw a UFO on paper randomly,the ecllipse in the middle can represent the magnitude, depth as the bottom part and gap as the upper part

**Concept 3 swrils:**
want to create a 3D version
the radius of each swril can be the magnitude, and the deeper the earthquake, the more the circles inside the circle.

## Part2 Try Out
When i use timestamp as XY , the earthquakes are overlapped with each other, I need to make the graph very large

Also i lost my ideas of map, cannot think any create ways to show earthquake, besides bubbles on the map
The details can be found in the folder
